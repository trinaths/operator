## F5 BIG-IP Controller Operator

An Operator is a method of packaging, deploying and managing a Kubernetes application. A Kubernetes application is an application that is both deployed on Kubernetes and managed using the Kubernetes APIs and kubectl/oc tooling. You can think of Operators as the runtime that manages this type of application on Kubernetes. 

Conceptually, an Operator takes human operational knowledge and encodes it into software that is more easily packaged and shared with consumers. 

F5 BIG-IP Controller Operator is a Service Operator which installs F5 BIG-IP Controller (Container Ingress Services) on Kubernetes and OpenShift platforms and respective supported versions.
